### Description: This plug-in provides a solution to set thresholds on the actual number of megabytes of disk space available on any given file system. It will find the file system with the least available space and generate alerts using thresholds based on acceptable space remaining on a volume.
We recommend you use the built-in File System Capacity Monitor as it now has the same functionality.

### Supported Monitoring Stations: 5.5
